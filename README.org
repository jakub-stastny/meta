* About

Repository management tool. It queries the GitHub API and clones all the repositories from a given GitHub account.

This allows for:

- Updating files like =.editorconfig= of all the projects in one place.
- Back up all the projects.

* Dependencies

Installed and authenticated [[https://cli.github.com][GitHub CLI]].

* Usage
** =bin/clone=

- On the first run, it will clone all your repositories that are not blacklisted.
- On subsequent runs, it will clone any new repositories that are not blacklisted and updates the already cloned ones. If it finds a cloned repository that is now blacklisted, it will delete it.

*** Repository blacklist

- Variable =BLACKLIST= with space-separated list of repositories to ignore.
- For instance: ~BLACKLIST="my-old-repo-1 my-old-repo-2" ./bin/clone~.
